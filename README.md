# ROSplane

[![ROS2 CI](https://github.com/rosflight/rosplane/actions/workflows/ros2-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rosflight/rosplane/actions/workflows/ros2-ci.yml)

ROSplane is a basic fixed-wing autopilot build around ROS2 for use with the ROSflight autopilot. It is a continuation of the original [ROSplane](https://github.com/byu-magicc/rosplane) project. It is built according to the methods published in Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice by Dr. Randy Beard and Dr. Tim McLain.

For more information, see the [ROSflight documentation](https://docs.rosflight.org/git-main/user-guide/concepts/rosplane-overview/).

A special thanks is due to the developers of ROSplane v1.0. Their work allowed for the project in its current form.
These include Gary Ellingson, who did much of the original development into C++ of these algorithms.
Thanks are also due to Judd Mehr and Brian Russel who adapted work for ROSplane.
